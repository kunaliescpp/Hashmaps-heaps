Build Min Heap

You are given an array 'ARR' of integers having 'N' elements. Your task is to convert the input array into a min-Binary Heap.
A min-Binary heap is a complete binary tree in which the value of each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values of the 
children of that node.

Note :
1. Input array follows 0 - based indexing. 
2. After constructing the min-heap, the Left child of the 'i-th' node should be present at the (2*i + 1)-th index if it exists.
3. After constructing the min-heap, the Right child of the 'i-th' node should be present at the (2*i + 2)-th index if it exists.
4. Note that you do not need to create a tree, just update the array.

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^4
-10^9 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
Where 'ARR[i]' denotes the 'i-th' element of the array 'ARR'.

Sample Input 1 :
2
5
9 3 2 6 7 
4
1 3 2 4
Sample Output 1 :
1
1
Explanation For Sample Input 1 : For the first test case: One possible min-heap representation of the input array is the 
array [ 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 ]. Note that other arrays like [ 2, 6, 3, 9, 7 ], [ 2, 3, 6, 9, 7 ] also represent min-heap.

For the second test case:  The input array is already a min-heap, so we do not need to modify it.
Sample Input 2 :
2
5
1 3 5 4 6
3
8 9 0
Sample Output 2 :
1 
1
Explanation For Sample Input 2 : For the first test case: One possible min-heap representation of the input array is the array 
[ 1, 3, 5, 4, 6 ] which is the same as the input array. 

For the second test case: 
One possible min-heap representation of the input array is the array [ 0, 8, 9 ].
